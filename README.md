# life-expectancy-causal-inference
This repository contains my research paper, as well as all of the data and tools I used to do my analysis. 

My research paper can be found [here](npl1_project%20(2).pdf)

The initial dataset that I retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) is [here](originalLifeData.csv), and the winsorized dataset that I used for my analysis is [here](winsorizedFinalData1.csv)

The graph elicitation I did using the program, Tetrad, can be found [here](finalProject.tet)

The actual code I ran after eliciting the graph, which I used for my analysis as well as sensitivity testing on my graph can be found [here](analysis_code.py)

The graph I generated using Matplotlib to calcualte the average causal effect is [here](lifeExpectPlot3.pdf)
